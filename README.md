# 🚀 GPFlow – A Developer-Focused Workflow Automation Engine (Portfolio Project)

**GPFlow** is a **portfolio project** that reimagines workflow automation tools like n8n through a modern, developer-centric lens. It demonstrates my ability to design, build, and scale a visual automation system using **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, and **secure code execution techniques**.

> ⚠️ **Frontend UI development is currently in progress** using **Next.js App Router** and **React Flow** for drag-and-drop workflow building.

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Showcase **OOP-driven architecture** and reusable design patterns.
- Build a **custom workflow engine** that runs node-based automation logic.
- Enable **secure JS execution** using `worker_threads` and `isolated-vm` (no `eval` or `vm2`).
- Provide a maintainable, clean frontend foundation (in progress).

## 🔧 Technologies & Architecture

| Area            | Stack                                           |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend        | Next.js App Router, React Flow, Tailwind CSS _(WIP)_ |
| Backend/Core    | TypeScript, Node.js, Worker Threads              |
| Execution Layer | isolated-vm, Handlebars templating, JEXL         |
| Email           | Nodemailer with dynamic `From` and `Reply-To`    |
| Patterns        | Factory Pattern, Registry Pattern, Pure OOP      |

## 📦 Supported Node Types

- **HTTP Node** – Trigger APIs with dynamic input
- **Webhook Node** – Create and receive custom webhook requests
- **Function Node** – Run secure JS logic inside sandboxed workers
- **Condition Node** – Branch logic dynamically using JEXL
- **Delay Node** – Pause workflow execution for specified time
- **Email Node** – Send templated emails (Gmail support included)
- **GPT Node (Planned)** – Integrate OpenAI-powered logic blocks

## 💡 Why I Built This

This project is part of my transition into **AI and automation-focused roles**. I wanted to challenge myself with a real-world system that blends:

- **Backend systems engineering**
- **Frontend UX for visual builders** (coming soon)
- **Secure code execution**
- **Modern, scalable TypeScript design**

It serves as a **foundation** for future AI-integrated automation platforms.

> ✅ Built with real-world system design in mind, GPFlow is more than a clone — it’s a showcase of how I design, think, and build.
